        <item>A Star is Born was met with a rapturous reception at its Venice Film Festival première earlier this year, and has since gone on to receive near universal critical acclaim (90% on Rotten Tomatoes at time of writing), with much speculation as to its staying-power come award season. And whilst I liked it, and found a great deal to admire, I didn\’t love it. At least I didn\’t love all of it. \n - by Stephen Campbell</item>
        <item>I have to say that, overall, I had quite a blast watching this movie. It is indeed a good superhero and special effects extravaganza. In addition it is quite beautiful. A lot of the underwater scenes are very pleasing on the eye indeed. I am quite happy that I managed to drag my ass over to a theater and watch it on a IMAX screen. Some of the hype around it is perhaps a bit too much though. It does not quite reach the masterpiece level after all. \n - by Per Gunnar Jonsson</item>
        <item>For a movie with this much riding it, to come out not feeling disappointed, is a massive achievement. While I absolutely do love it I had some things that I felt were maybe imperfect about Infinity War, but my biggest concern was that it seemed like it would be absolutely meaningless to somebody who didn\’t put in the effort of watching the 18 movies leading up to it. You can probably assuage that fear though, because I went to see it with two people who had only seen Black Panther at this point, and they both loved it, with minimal confusion. \n - by Gimly</item>
        <item>The concept behind the mass crisis is where the movie fails. It\’s sort of explained and yet it isn\’t. There are too many inconsistencies and what appears to be plot holes. It\’s basically a bunch of malarkey and reflects lazy writing. People on message boards debate back-and-forth ad nauseam, but the movie\’s too nonsensical and meh to make it worth the effort. \n - by Wuchak</item>
        <item>Bohemian Rhapsody is not a biography of Freddie Mercury, nor a biopic of Queen. It\’s a story based on a selection of key events occurring between the formation of the band and their appearance at Live Aid. As a Queen fan I found this film utterly engrossing and enjoyable. The acting brilliantly invokes the characters in the band and the music provides a thumping rhythm to carry the story along. Queen aficionados may be affronted by the out of sequence music performances and the highly selective approach to the story telling but if you can see past that, you\’ll enjoy a storming film with a spine-tingling conclusion as the Live Aid performance is brilliantly recreated. \n - by Richard_a_Kirk</item>
        <item>Strong contender for best live-action Transformers movie ever made, but Christ, what a low fuckin\’ bar that is. The fact it isn\’t the clear and absolute winner is a devastating criticism. \n - by Gimly</item>
        <item>that\’s the movie I wanted to see badly for a long time I watched its first part that was too awesome and creed 2 is marvelous I had to do my college homework but I skipped that just to watch creed 2 the training part and the last fight I can\’t describe in words what I feels after watched. \n - by frank12</item>

        <item>The best dream-works movie yet for kids and quizlet teens !!! It has a great story, great animation and great characters here\’s my review: The story: 10/10 the animation: 10/10 and the characters: 10/10 the movie: 10/10!!! \n - by betty.vogl</item>
        <item>All in all, Dragon Ball Z might be better due to its impeccable balance between story and action. However, Dragon Ball Super will always be the saga that I will never forget. The epicness surrounding the characters, the beautifully choreographed fight scenes, the jaw-dropping animation quality and the chills induced by the amazing score … It\’s so freaking awesome! It\’s a fact that it took a while to get to the level the show presented in the last arc. The first couple of “seasons” are really painful, but the cinematic alternatives are a great way to partially skip the first 30 episodes or so. From the third arc on, it\’s an adventure that I will cherish for a long, long time. Super\’s fillers rarely feel like such and the series\’ attempts at comedy are actually pretty funny. \n - by msbreviews</item>
        <item>If you\’re a comic-book fan, this trilogy is mandatory. If you love Marvel or DC, don\’t you dare use the word “grounded” without watching this saga first. Shyamalan, see you around! \n - by msbreviews</item>
        <item>This movie could have been decent, if the producers and script-writers had only spent some time researching facts about how the military and special forces work IRL. Instead, they decided to throw reality to the wind and use fantasy and make-believe to create contrived conveniences to support a predictable storyline. I don\’t mind when a movie asks me to suspend belief a little. But, this one asks us to leave all rational thinking at the door. \n - by thecrustycurmudgeon</item>
        <item>Apart from that, end Tom\’s whining and naivety, I really liked this movie. It was the kind of over the top, fantasy/fiction movie with a big budget that you do not see every day. Of course the dickwads, a.ka “critics”) at Rotten Tomatoes and other mainstream media assholes did their best to tell everyone how bad it was. As usual that\’s just the stuff that comes out of the south end of a north bound bull. \n - by Per Gunnar Jonsson</item>
        <item>The entire quality of animation and visual effects that are present in Mary Poppins Returns almost to perfect. Everything goes fancy and there\'s no slightest reproach in this section. So, besides being nominated for \"Best Original Score\", Mary Poppins Returns was also nominated for \"Best Picture\" at the 2019 Golden Globe event. \n - by kincir.com</item>
        <item>Not just comedy. This film is also full of moral values, you know! A lot of lessons can be taken from the movie Preman Pensiun. One of them is that the lead is not only giving orders, but also bearing all the problems of the people we lead. When members get into trouble, the leader also feels the impact. \n - by kincir.com</item>

        <item>It\’s true I liked it less than perhaps the vast majority of Spider-Verse\’s audience, but this was still great, the animation enamouring, and the depth of its story and reference totally engaging. Not to me the best Spider-Man movie as many have said, (that honour still goes to Homecoming) but a blast all the same. \n - by Gimly</item>
        <item>In the end we are left with a film that could have been greater than it is, but which was hobbled by a poor script filled with overly convenient contrivances. The film\’s one saving grace is Foy, who does the most with what she is given.</item>
        <item>there hasn\’t been a recent review yet</item>
        <item>On the other hand Venom is really the star of the movie. Both as a “thing” and as a character. He is a real bad-ass, quite funny and really everything that Eddie should have been as a character. He even develops more as a character than previously mentioned douche-bag. It\’s a shame since otherwise this would have been a great movie. The story is simple but works well for this kind of movie. There are no silly twists and convoluted sub-plots. The main protagonist, as poor as he is, at least do not carry a lot of past history trying to explain God knows what and such stuff. If the character of the main protagonist would have been more likable this would have been a great movie. Now it is “just” good.</item>
